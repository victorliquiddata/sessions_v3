### Activity: Warm-up
Lesson Overview: Meeting New People - Warm-Up (5 minutes)

Activity: Icebreaker - "Two Truths and a Lie"

Teaching Notes:

-   Explain the game: Each person shares three "facts" about themselves – two true, one false.  Others guess the lie.
-   Model the game first: Share your own two truths and a lie to demonstrate.  Keep it light and engaging. Examples: "I once met a celebrity", "I can juggle", "I've lived in another country".
-   Encourage participation:  Make it clear that all answers are acceptable and there's no right or wrong guess. Emphasize having fun.
-   Keep it brief:  Five minutes is a short time.  Aim for 2-3 participants sharing if time is limited.  Adjust based on class size and student engagement.
-   Adapt as needed:  If the student seems uncomfortable, offer simpler alternatives.  For instance, asking a simple "What's your favorite color?" or “What’s something you like to do in your free time?” can work as well.


Teacher-Student Interaction:

[Teacher]:  "Let's play a game called 'Two Truths and a Lie'! I'll go first.  My three statements are: I love spicy food, I've climbed a mountain, and I can speak French.  Which one is the lie?"

[Student]:  [Student guesses, e.g., "I think the lie is that you can speak French."]

[Teacher]: "Correct!  I wish I could speak French.  Now it's your turn! Think of two true things and one lie about yourself."

[Student]: [Student shares their two truths and a lie]
