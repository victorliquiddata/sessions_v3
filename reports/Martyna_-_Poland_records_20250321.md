Teacher's Goal: To create a relaxed atmosphere and encourage Martyna to participate.

Activity:  Simple Icebreaker - "Two Truths and a Lie"

Teaching Notes:

- Explain the game: Each person shares three "facts" about themselves – two true, one false.  Others guess the lie.
-  Keep it simple and visual.  You can write the three "facts" on a whiteboard or large piece of paper.
- Model the game first.  Share your own two truths and a lie (related to simple, relatable topics like hobbies or favourite food).  Encourage guessing.
-  Let Martyna choose her own “facts”, assisting with vocabulary or pronunciation if needed.  Focus on participation, not grammatical perfection.
-  After the game, briefly discuss the truths and lies.  This allows for natural conversation and vocabulary reinforcement.

Teacher-Student Interaction:

[Teacher]: "Let's play a game to get to know each other better.  It's called 'Two Truths and a Lie'. I'll go first!"
[Student]: (Listens and participates in guessing the teacher's lie)


[Teacher]: "Now it's your turn, Martyna. Think of two things that are true about you and one thing that is false."
[Student]: (Shares her two truths and a lie.  May need help with vocabulary or pronunciation.  Teacher provides gentle correction and support.)


[Teacher]:  "That's great!  Which one do you think is the lie?" (To other students if applicable)
[Student]: (Participates in discussion, attempts to guess the other students' lies if applicable.)

  - *Teacher Notes:* Lesson: Meeting New People - Listening & Speaking (10 minutes)

Target:  Improving listening comprehension and basic conversational skills related to introductions and small talk.

Materials:  Short audio clip (approx. 2 minutes) of two people meeting and making small talk.  Prepare a few simple questions beforehand.


Procedure:

- Play the audio clip once.  Ask Martyna: "What did you hear?"  Expect a general response, even if fragmented.

- Play the audio clip again, pausing at key points. Ask comprehension questions such as: "Where did they meet?", "What are their names?", "What did they talk about?". Expect simple answers, even single words or phrases.

- Introduce key vocabulary:  "hello", "nice to meet you", "my name is", "where are you from?", "what do you do?". Write them on the board.

- Practice simple greetings and introductions. Teacher models, then Martyna repeats.

[Teacher]:  "Hello, my name is [Teacher's Name]. Nice to meet you."
[Student]: "Hello, my name is Martyna. Nice to meet you."

-  Practice asking and answering simple questions.

[Teacher]: "Where are you from?"
[Student]: "I'm from Poland."

[Teacher]: "What do you like to do?"
[Student]:  (Any simple answer, e.g., "I like to read.")

-  If time permits, role-play a short conversation between two people meeting for the first time, using the learned vocabulary and phrases. Provide support and positive reinforcement throughout.


Assessment: Observe Martyna's participation and comprehension.  Focus on effort and progress, not perfection.  Adjust the activity based on her level as you proceed.
