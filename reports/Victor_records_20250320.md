### Unit: Arrival & Settling In

#### Lesson: Chloe Arrives in London

**Feedback:** VAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAI

##### Blocks:
- **Block 1: Warm-up**
  - *Description:* Discuss what students know about London.
  - *Student Speech Notes:* Lesson Overview: Meeting New People - Warm-Up (5 minutes)

Activity: Icebreaker - "Two Truths and a Lie"

Teaching Notes:

-   Explain the game: Each person shares three "facts" about themselves – two true, one false.  Others guess the lie.
-   Model the game first: Share your own two truths and a lie to demonstrate.  Keep it light and engaging. Examples: "I once met a celebrity", "I can juggle", "I've lived in another country".
-   Encourage participation:  Make it clear that all answers are acceptable and there's no right or wrong guess. Emphasize having fun.
-   Keep it brief:  Five minutes is a short time.  Aim for 2-3 participants sharing if time is limited.  Adjust based on class size and student engagement.
-   Adapt as needed:  If the student seems uncomfortable, offer simpler alternatives.  For instance, asking a simple "What's your favorite color?" or “What’s something you like to do in your free time?” can work as well.


Teacher-Student Interaction:

[Teacher]:  "Let's play a game called 'Two Truths and a Lie'! I'll go first.  My three statements are: I love spicy food, I've climbed a mountain, and I can speak French.  Which one is the lie?"

[Student]:  [Student guesses, e.g., "I think the lie is that you can speak French."]

[Teacher]: "Correct!  I wish I could speak French.  Now it's your turn! Think of two true things and one lie about yourself."

[Student]: [Student shares their two truths and a lie]

Warm-up: Discussion (Teaching Notes)

Target:  To activate prior knowledge about London and travel experiences,  elicit vocabulary related to arrival and transportation, and to gauge Victor's English level.

Procedure:

- Begin with a general question about London: "Have you ever heard of London? What do you know about it?"  This opens the conversation and allows Victor to share what he already knows.  Encourage him to describe anything that comes to mind – landmarks, culture, people.

- Move on to travel:  "Have you ever travelled to a new place?  How did you feel when you arrived? What was the journey like?" This connects to the story's theme and allows for personal sharing.

- Introduce key vocabulary related to arrival:  "What words come to mind when you think about arriving somewhere new?  For example, excited, tired, confused..."  Write down any words Victor uses on the board.

- Show pictures of London landmarks (Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, etc.) and modes of transport (planes, trains, buses). Ask simple questions about them to further check comprehension and vocabulary.  For example:  "What is this?  Have you seen this before?"


Teacher-Student Interaction Examples:

[Teacher]: "Have you ever been to a big city?"
[Student]: "No, I haven't. But I've seen pictures of New York."

[Teacher]: "How do you think Chloe might feel arriving in London?"
[Student]: "Maybe excited, but also maybe a little nervous."

[Teacher]: "What is this?" (Showing a picture of a double-decker bus)
[Student]: "A bus.  A big bus."


Note: Adapt the questions and vocabulary to Victor's responses. Observe his level of English to tailor the rest of the lesson accordingly. If he struggles, simplify the language. If he's advanced, introduce more complex questions and vocabulary.

##### Blocks:

  - *Description:* Discuss daily routines.
  - *Student Speech Notes:* None
  - *Teacher Notes:* Lesson Overview: Chloe’s First Day at College

Block: Warm-up (Discussion)

Teaching Notes:  Begin by showing a picture depicting a college campus—busy, bustling, or perhaps a quiet, studious scene.  This will help to visually engage the student and initiate the topic.  The warm-up should focus on generating excitement and anticipation for the story.  Adapt questions based on the student's apparent level.

Teacher-Student Interaction Examples:

[Teacher]:  "Imagine your first day at a new college.  How would you feel?"
[Student]:  "Nervous, excited, maybe a little scared."  (or similar)

[Teacher]:  "What are some things you might worry about on your first day of college?"
[Student]:  "Finding my classes, meeting new people, making friends." (or similar)

[Teacher]: "What are you most looking forward to about starting college?"
[Student]: "Learning new things, meeting new people, living independently." (or similar)


If the student seems very young or lacks experience with this concept, simplify the questions. For example:
[Teacher]: "What's something new and exciting that happened to you recently?"
[Student]: (Student describes an event)
[Teacher]: "How did that make you feel?  Today we'll read about Chloe's exciting first day!"


Adjust the questions and conversation to gauge the student's understanding and vocabulary level.  Keep it light and engaging to build rapport before proceeding to the main lesson.

  - *Student Speech Notes:* None
  - *Teacher Notes:* Lesson Overview: Chloe's First Day at College

Grammar Focus:  Simple Past Tense & Descriptive Adjectives

Teaching Notes:

- Review simple past tense formation (regular and irregular verbs).  Focus on verbs related to experiences (e.g., arrive, meet, see, feel, eat, walk).

- Introduce descriptive adjectives to enrich storytelling.  Examples: nervous, excited, crowded, large, friendly, confusing.  Show how adjectives modify nouns.

- Practice using both simple past tense and descriptive adjectives in sentences related to Chloe’s experience.  For example: "Chloe felt nervous on her first day."  "The campus was large and crowded."

Teacher-Student Interaction Examples:

[Teacher]: Tell me about Chloe's arrival using the simple past.
[Student]: Chloe arrived at college early.

[Teacher]: Describe the campus using adjectives.
[Student]: The campus was big and beautiful.

[Teacher]:  Make a sentence about Chloe meeting someone.
[Student]: Chloe met a friendly student in the library.

[Teacher]:  What did Chloe feel? Use an adjective.
[Student]: Chloe felt excited to start classes.


Differentiation:  For higher levels, incorporate more complex sentence structures and vocabulary. For lower levels, provide sentence starters and focus on core vocabulary.

  - *Student Speech Notes:* None
  - *Teacher Notes:* Teaching Notes: Chloe's First Day at College - Writing Activity

This activity focuses on descriptive writing and narrative structure.  Adapt the complexity based on Victor's observed writing level.  Start with simple sentence structures if needed, gradually increasing complexity.

- Begin by reviewing key vocabulary related to college life (e.g., lecture hall, dorm, professor, syllabus).

- Discuss the story prompt: "Imagine you are Chloe. Describe your first day at college, including your feelings and experiences."

- Guide Victor through brainstorming:  What did Chloe see? Hear? Smell? Feel?  Who did she meet? What were her thoughts and emotions?

- If Victor struggles, provide sentence starters like: "I felt… when I…", "The campus looked…", "My first class was about…", "I met a student named…"

- Encourage vivid descriptions using sensory details.  For example, instead of "The campus was big," encourage "The sprawling campus felt both exciting and overwhelming."

Teacher-Student Interaction Examples:

[Teacher]: "What was the first thing Chloe noticed when she arrived on campus?"
[Student]: "The big buildings."

[Teacher]: "Can you describe the buildings in more detail? What did they look like?"
[Student]: "They were tall and made of brick."

[Teacher]: "Excellent! Now, what were Chloe’s feelings at that moment? Was she nervous, excited, or both?"
[Student]: "She was excited, but a little nervous too."


- Review the finished writing focusing on sentence structure, vocabulary, and descriptive language.  Offer positive feedback and constructive criticism.  If necessary, help with spelling and grammar. The focus should be on fostering creativity and enjoyment of writing.  No need for perfection at this stage.

│ We use "can" and "could" to ask for things politely.  Both mean "to be able to," but "could" is more polite.  Think of "could" as a softer, more formal version of "can."                    │
│                                                                                                                                                                                              │
│ * **Can:**  We use "can" for general requests and when we're not sure if the person can help. It's more informal.                                                                            │
│                                                                                                                                                                                              │
│ * **Could:** We use "could" when we want to be more polite, or when we're asking for a favor. It suggests more hesitation or uncertainty on the part of the speaker.                         │
